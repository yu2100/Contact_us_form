        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p id= "intro"> My name is Uloma. I love technology because it's the triumph of the <strong>human intellect</strong>. The more i study and understand technology, the more i feel
            that nothing in the universe is out of reach. There's even a great rush of power that comes from coding your first simple "Hello World" program. 
            Getting it to run successfully, seeing those two word on the screen and knowing that YOU put them there just makes you think of the endless possibilities.
            It lets you have more free time. It makes you smarter. <strong>It helps you keep in touch</strong>. It's fun. It gives you better job oprotunities.It saves time and money.
            <span class="emphasized">Reasons</span> to love technology are numerous, and great, and rocksolid.I love technology because i believe in progress. People inevitably use technology to improve lives and help others. we spread knowledge, make tasks easier, and make systems more efficient.I love technology because it allows me to multiply my efforts in ways that are remarkable. i can stay connected with friends and family, while simultaneously working on a critical component of work-in any city, in any country, anywhere.
            Technology eliminates problems otherwise posed by geography and time.

        <h3 class="demo">Cascading Style Sheet</h3>
        <p id ="css"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used for website layout in design and used alongside HTML. CSS is a styling language.
           <strong> CSS makes the frontend of website shine and creates a great user experience</strong>.Css is very important because it has the ability to <em>specify fonts other than the default for the browser</em> , it helps to specify color and size of text and links,
            apply colors to backgrounds, contain webpage elements in boxes and float those boxes to specific positions on the page. I have learnt so far that <em>Classes and IDs </em> are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric. <em>Pseuso-classes</em> are uses in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not 
            contained in the document tree. <em>Selectors</em> declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself
